    "### As a signal for test, measurement, and calibration\n",
    "The first application is to use a PN sequence to estimate an impulse response of an unknown subsystem, e.g. the cascade of a source, empty chamber, and receiver in a biomedical instrument. Once the impulse response is known, calibration of the system can proceed by means of a linear time-invariant filter in the transmitter (known as a predistorter) or receiver (known as an equalizer) to compensate for the distortion in the subsystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### As a training signal\n",
    "As a training signal, the PN sequence would be the digital data to be transmitted over the unknown communication channel. The receiver knows the bits that had been transmitted, and can use that knowledge to adapt receiver settings to improve communication performance (signal quality). The receiver can also estimate the impulse response of the communication channel if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data scrambler/descrabler\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary application of PN sequences in lab #4 is for data scrambling and descrambling. As a data scrambling sequence, pseudonoise can (1) eliminate strong DC components (long strongs of zeros and ones) in the baseband signal and (2) disperse the power spectrum to mitigate the effects of certain channel impairments.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Eliminating DC components**\n",
    "\n",
    "    During a long string of zeros or ones, the primary frequency component in the signal would be at DC. For baseband transmission, this would not get passed by some communication channels (e.g. voiceband and acoustic channels). Some automatic gain control algorithms will also fail in the presence of a strong DC components. For bandpass transmission, the DC component is upconverted to sit at the carrier frequency. Strong components at this frequency will hinder the clock recovery and symbol synchronization subsystems.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mitigating channel impairments**\n",
    "\n",
    "    If a baseband signal has most of its power concentrated at specific frequencies, scrambling with a PN sequence can help disperse the spectrum to mitigate certain channel impairments. For example, a common impairment caused by nonlinearity or time-variance is intermodulation, or cross-modulation. The effect of intermodulation is greatly reduced by dispersing the power spectrum and eliminating signal components concentrated at specific frequencies."
