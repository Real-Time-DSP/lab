    "Suppose that we want to estimate the time-varying fundamental frequency $f_0$ of a speech recording with an update rate of about 25 Hz. We can divide the input signal into frames which are roughly $\\frac{1}{25 \\text{ Hz}} = 40 \\text{ ms}$ long. For a sampling rate of 48 kHz, this would mean that we want to produce an estimate every $\\frac{48 \\text{ kHz}}{25 \\text{ Hz}} = 1920$ samples, though for convenience we will round this to to a power of two (2048).\n",
